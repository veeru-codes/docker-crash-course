# Docker Crash Course

## What is a container?

A container is an isolated environment for your code. It does not know your operating system or your files. It runs on the environment provided to you by Docker Desktop. Containers have everything your code needs to run, down to a base operating system.

> Containers make applications portable, allowing the same code to run on any device. This makes it easier for developers and IT professionals to deploy applications across environments.

## What is Docker?

Docker is an open-source containerization platform. It enables developers to package applications into containers â€“ standalone, executable packages of software that include everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings.

Docker containers isolate software from its surroundings, for example, differences between development and staging environments, and help reduce conflicts between teams running different software on the same infrastructure.

It can be run on any computing environment, from a developer's laptop to a virtual machine or the cloud. This makes it easy to build, ship, and run applications anywhere.

### Benefits of Docker

1. Portability
2. Efficiency
3. Scalability
4. Security

Docker is a popular choice for developing, deploying, and running microservices-based applications. Microservices are small, independent services that communicate with each other through well-defined APIs. Docker containers are a good fit for microservices because they are lightweight, portable, and scalable.

Docker is also a popular choice for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. CI/CD is a set of practices that automates the building, testing, and deployment of software. Docker containers can be used to create consistent development, testing, and production environments, which makes it easier to deploy software quickly and reliably.
